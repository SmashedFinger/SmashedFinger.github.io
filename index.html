<p>You're probably here for the Run8 Primer that I created. Please click the link below to download the PDF, or read on for more information!</p>

<p>Coming Soon! Watch for a link to download the PDF here.</p>
<p>I created the Run8 Primer to help players new to Run8 and/or prototypical railroading orient themselves with the sim.</p>
<p>I was bothered that there wasn't a single document that could be shown to someone that would teach them how to use the Run8 simulator. Now there is!</p>
<p>While there were many good resources available covering individual topics, there were gaps between them. If you hear a term you don't know, you should be able to "ctrl+F" and find information on it here.</p>
<p>I wrote about many things, and included visuals, but I have also included links to some of those other resources throughout the document that go more in-depth on some topics.</p>
<p>After studying this document, and driving practice trains in the sim, you should be able to pass a checkride and join Run8 servers that expect you to know what you're doing.</p>
<p>Feedback welcome on Github, the Depot forum, and messaging me on Discord.</p>
