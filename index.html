<p>I created the Run8 Primer to help players new to Run8 and/or prototypical railroading orient themselves with the sim.</p>
<p>I was bothered that there wasn't a single document that could be shown to someone to teach them how to use the Run8 simulator in-depth. Now there is!</p>
<p>Topics covered include controls, menus, train types and symbols, signals and switches, and more, with visuals assisting where appropriate.</p>
<p>While there are many good resources available covering individual topics, there are gaps between them. If you see or hear a term you don't know, you should be able to "ctrl+F" in the Run8 Primer and find basic information on it. I have also included links to some of those other resources throughout the document that go more in-depth on some topics.</p>
<p>After studying this document, and getting to grips with driving trains in Run8, you should be able to pass a checkride and join Run8 servers that expect you to know what you're doing.</p>
<p>If you have feedback, please message me on Discord or the Depot forums! Corrections are appreciated, I do not have "real world" railroading experience.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who has taught me the knowledge I'm passing on in writing! I would not have done this if not for the love of the community.</p>
