<p>Coming Soon!</p>
<p>I created the Run8 Primer to help players new to Run8 and/or prototypical railroading orient themselves with the sim.</p>
<p>I was bothered that there wasn't a single document that could be shown to someone that would give them much of the knowledge that would help them understand how the sim works and the concepts involved. Now there is!</p>
<p>While I wrote about many things, and included visuals, I have also included links to other resources throughout the document that go more in-depth on some topics.</p>
<p>Link will be here</p>
<p>Feedback welcome on Github, the Depot forum, and messaging me on discord.</p>
